# How to contribute

Here are some important resources:

  * Email: Dr. Jumadinova (jjumadinova@allegheny.edu), or Kate Folkenroth (folkenrothk@allegheny.edu).
  * Bugs? Use the GitHub Issue Tracker, unless the issue is security related, in  which case email either of the two people above.

## Testing

//

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to misinformation](//) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](//)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the website will generally not be accepted.

## Do you want to contribute to the website's documentation?

You can help improve the website guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest //.

To do so, make changes to // guides source files (located here on GitHub) or comments in source code. Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Please email either Dr. Jumadinova or Kate Folkenroth for any and all questions related to the website's repository.
