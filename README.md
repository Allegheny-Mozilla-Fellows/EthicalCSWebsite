### A [website](https://csethics.allegheny.edu) created by the innovative Allegheny Mozilla Fellows team.  

The Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College launched the
Allegheny Ethical CS initiative that aims to integrate responsible
computing into its curriculum. This work, funded by the [Mozilla
Responsible CS Challenge](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/responsible-cs/)
grant, accomplishes this goal in a multitude of ways, including the establishment of
the Allegheny Mozilla Fellows program, development of application-level course materials,
as well as the creation and implementation of the proactive programming principles.
