## About the Repository

### A [website](https://csethics.allegheny.edu) created by the innovative Allegheny Mozilla Fellows team.  

The Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College launched the Allegheny Ethical CS initiative that aims to integrate responsible computing into its curriculum. This work, funded by the [Mozilla Responsible CS Challenge](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/responsible-cs/) grant, accomplishes this goal in a multitude of ways, including the establishment of the Allegheny Mozilla Fellows program, development of application-level course materials, as well as the creation and implementation of the proactive programming principles.
