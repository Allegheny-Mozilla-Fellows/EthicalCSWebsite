## The Allegheny Ethics Technical Leaders

The Allegheny Ethical Computer Science Initiative at Allegheny College involves Ethics Technical Leaders (ETLs) who work on various projects for this initiative. They develop automated grading and analyzing tools,  help create concepts and implementations for class activities and lab assignments, implement testing, run focus groups and break out sessions. Throughout their work, ETLs also gain a valuable insight from interrogating issues of social responsibility in computing and from reflecting on their own computer science studies.
