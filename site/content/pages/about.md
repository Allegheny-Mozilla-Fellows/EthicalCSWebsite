## The Allegheny Mozilla Fellows Program

The Allegheny Mozilla Fellows program at Allegheny College includes students majoring in Computer Science who work on various projects for the Allegheny Ethical CS initiative. They develop automated grading and analyzing tools, they help create concepts and implementations for class activities and lab assignments, they do testing, they run focus groups and break out sessions. Throughout their work, Mozilla Fellows also gain a valuable insight from interrogating issues of social responsibility in computing and from reflecting on their own computer science studies.
