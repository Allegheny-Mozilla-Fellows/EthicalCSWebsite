"For my Mozilla project, I have created a web server that is connected to a database and the whole idea of this project is for the students to try and simulate hacking a website to extract valuable information. This web server kind of mimics what a bank website might be like. The type of information that the students can extract is someoneâ€™s salary, address, marital status as well as other information. The idea behind this is to think about the ethics of this. Just because you have the ability to hack something or someone, does that mean you should do it if it causes harm?"
